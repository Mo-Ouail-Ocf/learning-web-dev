/***********************/
sync:things happening together in the order set up.

setTimeOut is an asynchronous function ,not synchronized
with the rest of the code  , like ordering pizza 
we dont wait , we do other things wheras the pizza is
being prepared
examples of async code:
    fetching,backend api,loading files,time and intervals
sync:blocks code until being executed while async doesnt
/***************************/
Promises:
there are 

        -promise maker:returns promise object
        since async process takes unkown ammount of time , function needs to
        return smth immediately,otherwise it returns unknown,instead returning data;
        it returns the promise of some data
            --->Promise object :takes a function of async logic;this latter
            takes two parameters:one we call if the promise is sucsessfully fulfilled(resolve);
            the other is failure of promise (reject).
            -->three states of promise :pending(Waiting),success , failure
        -promise receiver:calls the maker and do smth with the promise
            getweather().then((data)=>{ //the data returned from resolve
                log(data);
            },(data)=>log('failure'))

        getweather().then(onSuccess,OnError);
        //these two are functions which by default the data
        returned by resolve or reject as parameter

        -->chaining Promises
            promise1()
            .then(promise2)
            .then(OnSuccess,OnFailure)
